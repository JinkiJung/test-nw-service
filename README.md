# GitHub template repository for G1128 service specification

You can collaborate on the service-specification.md file for the specification then the repository will turn the file into a nicely-formatted pdf for you.

The document template is aligned with the [IALA's G1128 service specification format](https://www.iala-aism.org/product/g1128-specification-e-navigation-technical-services/).
